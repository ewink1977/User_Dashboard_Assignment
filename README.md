<h1>Welcome to the DashboardApp!</h1>
<p>This is a cool application using MVC framework. This application was built by edubya (Erin Winking) using 
    a wirewrame supplied by Coding Dojo.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is an Django assignment app to help me prepare for my belt exam. With this app I will:</p>

<h2>Manage Users</h2>
<p>Using this application you'll be able to add, remove, and edit users for the application!</p>

<h2>Leave Messages</h2>
<p>Users are able to leave a message for another user using this application, and also be able to 
    comment on the messages that others, or they themselves, have left!</p>

<h2>Edit User Information</h2>
<p>Admins are able to edit another user's information (email address, first name, last name, etc.).</p>

<h2>User Dashboards</h2>
<p>The name of the damn app! There will be two dashboards, one for regular users and one for admins
    that will list ALL of the users and allow you access to their 'Walls'!</p>

<hr>
<p>I also ended up having to use some jQuery & jQueryUI to get a confirmation box to work like I
    wanted it too! Neato.</p>

<p>Look forward to actual projects being uploaded soon as I get through the exam and start working on
    stuff for my resume! Thanks!</p>
